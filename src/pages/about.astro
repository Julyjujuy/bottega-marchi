          <p class="max-w-prose">
           Born and raised in Venice, Emanuele Marchi comes from a long line of skilled artisans. As a third-generation woodcarver, he strives to preserve and evolve his family craft. After studying the art of traditional wood carving and engraving in Venice, he continued his training at a furniture-making school in Germany, gaining technical skills to complement his artisanal expertise.
           </p>

          <p class="max-w-prose">
            Working between Venice and Stuttgart, Emanuele focuses on designing and creating frames, furniture, and decorative objects in wood. Each piece is a unique, hand-carved creation, inspired by Venice’s timeless architectural motifs and the subtle, natural hues of the Laguna.
          </p>

          <p class="max-w-prose">
            Emanuele seamlessly intertwines Venetian tradition with his own contemporary vision, infusing his creations with a sense of modernity while paying homage to the city's rich artistic heritage.
