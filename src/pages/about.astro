          <p class="max-w-prose">
            Born in Venice and now based in Stuttgart, Emanuele crafts frames, mirrors, and sculptural wood objects entirely by hand.
            Each creation follows the natural flow of the wood, celebrating movement, texture, and light.

            With a sharp eye for detail and a deep respect for traditional craftsmanship, Emanuele brings custom commissions to life —
            from intricate carvings to bespoke frames and unique wooden objects.
